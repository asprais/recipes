This is an introduction describing what this project is and what skills I hope to learn
at the end of it.

This project is the creation of my first HTML website, which will be enchanced by CSS and
JavaScript in the future.

I hope to come out of this project with a much better handle on HTML and its commands, and
to have a clear understanding on how HTML works. I also hope to learn a bit of CSS, and 
possibly JavaScript if i get that far.
